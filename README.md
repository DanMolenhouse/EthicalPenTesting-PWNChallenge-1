### Details of Project

>I included both the problem statement, and my PDF submission in this repository. The submission itself had many issues, like the executive summary being too technical, and the second flag not being found. In this section I will walkthrough this project in a more succinct manner. 

**Step 1:**

As with any CTF challenge, I started out with some basic network scans to hopefully see some points of entry that we can immediately exploit. The rules of engagement specified two host ranges to attack: 10.20.160.10-150, and 10.20.170.20-100 so both of these ranges were scanned with the commands:

>nmap -open 10.20.160.10-150
>
>nmap -open 10.20.170.20-100

The results are shown in this screenshot:

**Step 2**

Based on the initial scan results, it is clear that 10.20.160.41 will be the host we will likely have to target first. Next I did a more detailed scan of this host with the following command:

>nmap -A 10.20.160.41

(maybe overly aggressive, I know) The results of the scans are as follows:
